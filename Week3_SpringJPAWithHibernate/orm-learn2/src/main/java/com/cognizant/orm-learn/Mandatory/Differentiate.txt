Difference between JPA, Hibernate, and Spring Data JPA:

JPA (Java Persistence API) is a specification that defines a standard for ORM in Java.
 It provides annotations like @Entity, @Table, @Id, and @OneToMany to map Java objects to database tables. 
However, JPA does not provide an actual implementation.

HIBERNATE is an implementation of the JPA specification.
It provides the actual functionality behind the annotations and includes additional features like caching and lazy loading.
Developers can use Hibernate directly to manage entity persistence, 
but it still requires writing boilerplate code for common queries and operations.

SPRING DATA JPA is an abstraction built on top of JPA (typically using Hibernate as the provider). 
It significantly reduces boilerplate code by automatically implementing repository methods based on method names (like findByName). 
It also integrates with Springâ€™s dependency injection and transaction management, making development faster and easier.
