# 📅 Week 1 – Design Principles and Patterns

This folder contains the Java exercises I completed as part of Week 1 of the DN 4.0 Java Full Stack Engineer program. The main focus this week was to learn object-oriented design principles like SOLID and explore popular design patterns such as Singleton, Factory, Builder, Adapter, and Strategy.

---

## ✅ Core Exercises (`Code/Mandatory/`)

These are the required exercises for Week 1:

- **Singleton Pattern** – Implemented in `SingletonExample.java`
- **Factory Method Pattern** – Implemented using `ShapeFactory.java`, `Main.java`, `Shape.java`, `Circle.java`, and `Square.java`
- **Binary Search Implementation** – Found in `ProductSearch.java`
- **Revenue Forecast using Arrays** – Created in `FinancialForecast.java`

---

## 💡 Additional Practice (`Code/HandsOn/`)

To enhance my understanding of design patterns, I also worked on a few extra hands-on tasks:

- **Builder Pattern** – `MealBuilderDemo.java`
- **Adapter Pattern** – `AdapterPatternDemo.java`
- **Strategy Pattern** – `StrategyPatternDemo.java`

These additional exercises helped reinforce the real-world use of different design pattern types: creational, structural, and behavioral.

## 🛠️ How to Compile and Run Java Files

To run any program from this week, open a terminal in the appropriate folder and use the commands below:

javac FileName.java  
java FileName

### Example:

javac StrategyPatternDemo.java  
java StrategyPatternDemo
